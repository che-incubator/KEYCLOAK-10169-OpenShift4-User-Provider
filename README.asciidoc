= OpenShift 4 extension

This project contains a custom OpenShift 4 extension that uses correct User Profile URL
(see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-10169[KEYCLOCK-10169]).

== How to install it?

In order to install this extension, you need to have Keycloak (I tested this with `6.0.1`) or RH-SSO `7.x`.

* Copy `target/openshift4-extension-6.0.1.jar` to `$KC_HOME/standalone/deployments`

[source,bash]
----
cp target/openshift4-extension-6.0.1.jar ~/rh-sso-7.1/standalone/deployments
----

* Start RHSSO:

[source,bash]
----
~/rh-sso-7.1/bin/standalone.sh
----

* Make sure the extension started properly. It will generate a warning (please ignore it):

[source,bash]
----
